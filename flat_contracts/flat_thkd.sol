/**
 * @title FinancialOpportunity
 * @dev Interface for third parties to implement financial opportunities
 *
 * -- Overview --
 * The goal of this contract is to allow anyone to create an opportunity
 * to earn interest on TUSD. deposit() "mints" yTUSD whcih is redeemable
 * for some amount of TUSD. TrueUSD wraps this contractwith TrustToken
 * Assurance, which provides protection from bugs and system design flaws
 * TUSD is a compliant stablecoin, therefore we do not allow transfers of
 * yTUSD, thus there are no transfer functions
 *
 * -- tokenValue() --
 * This function returns the value in TUSD of 1 yTUSD
 * This value should never decrease
 *
 * -- TUSD vs yTUSD --
 * yTUSD represents a fixed value which is redeemable for some amount of TUSD
 * Think of yTUSD like cTUSD, where cTokens are minted and increase in value versus
 * the underlying asset as interest is accrued
 *
 * -- totalSupply() --
 * This function returns the total supply of yTUSD issued by this contract
 * It is important to track this value accuratley and add/deduct the correct
 * amount on deposit/redemptions
 *
 * -- Assumptions --
 * - tokenValue can never decrease
 * - total TUSD owed to depositors = tokenValue() * totalSupply()
