/**
 * @title TrueRatingAgency
 * @dev Credit prediction market for LoanTokens
 *
 * TrueFi uses use a prediction market to signal how risky a loan is.
 * The Credit Prediction Market estimates the likelihood of a loan defaulting.
 * Any TRU holder can vote YES or NO and stake TRU as collateral on their vote.
 * If a loan is funded, TRU is locked into the market until expiry.
 * Locking TRU into the prediction market allows voters to earn and claim
 * incentive TRU throughout the course of the loan. After the loan's term,
 * if the voter is correct, they earn a TRU reward plus a portion of the
 * losing side's vote. A portion of the losing side's TRU is burned.
 *
 * Voting Lifecycle:
 * - Borrowers can apply for loans at any time by deploying a LoanToken
 * - LoanTokens are registered with the prediction market contract
 * - Once registered, TRU holders can vote at any time
 * - If a loan is funded, TRU is locked for the term of the loan
 * - At the end of the term, payouts are determined based on the loan outcome
 *
 * States:
 * Void:        Rated loan is invalid
 * Pending:     Waiting to be funded
 * Retracted:   Rating has been cancelled
 * Running:     Rated loan has been funded
 * Settled:     Rated loan has been paid back in full
 * Defaulted:   Rated loan has not been paid back in full
