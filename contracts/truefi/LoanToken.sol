 * @title LoanToken

 * - borrow amount
 * - loan duration

 *
 * Loan progresses through the following states:
 * Awaiting:    Waiting for funding to meet capital requirements
 * Funded:      Capital requirements met, borrower can withdraw
 * Withdrawn:   Borrower withdraws money, loan waiting to be repaid
 * Settled:     Loan has been paid back in full with interest
 * Defaulted:   Loan has not been paid back in full
 *
 * LoanTokens are non-transferrable except for whitelisted addresses
