 * @title LoanToken
 * @dev A token which represents share of a debt obligation
 *
 * Each LoanToken has:
 * - borrower address
 * - borrow amount
 * - loan term
 * - loan APY
 *
 * Loan progresses through the following states:
 * Awaiting:    Waiting for funding to meet capital requirements
 * Funded:      Capital requirements met, borrower can withdraw
 * Withdrawn:   Borrower withdraws money, loan waiting to be repaid
 * Settled:     Loan has been paid back in full with interest
 * Defaulted:   Loan has not been paid back in full
 * Liquidated:  Loan has Defaulted and stakers have been Liquidated
 *
 * - LoanTokens are non-transferable except for whitelisted addresses
 * - This version of LoanToken only supports a single funder
