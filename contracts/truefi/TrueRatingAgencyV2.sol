/**
 * @title TrueRatingAgencyV2
 * @dev Credit prediction market for LoanTokens
 *
 * TrueFi uses use a prediction market to signal how risky a loan is.
 * The Credit Prediction Market estimates the likelihood of a loan defaulting.
 * Any stkTRU holder can rate YES or NO and stake TRU as collateral on their rate.
 * Voting weight is equal to delegated governance power (see VoteToken.sol)
 * If a loan is funded, TRU is rewarded as incentive for participation
 * Rating stkTRU in the prediction market allows raters to earn and claim TRU
 * incentive when the loan is approved
 *
 * Voting Lifecycle:
 * - Borrowers can apply for loans at any time by deploying a LoanToken
 * - LoanTokens are registered with the prediction market contract
 * - Once registered, stkTRU holders can rate at any time
 *
 * States:
 * Void:        Rated loan is invalid
 * Pending:     Waiting to be funded
 * Retracted:   Rating has been cancelled
 * Running:     Rated loan has been funded
 * Settled:     Rated loan has been paid back in full
 * Defaulted:   Rated loan has not been paid back in full
 * Liquidated:  Rated loan has defaulted and stakers have been liquidated
