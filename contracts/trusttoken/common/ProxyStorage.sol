    /* Additionally, we have several keccak-based storage locations.
     * If you add more keccak-based storage mappings, such as mappings, you must document them here.
     * If the length of the keccak input is the same as an existing mapping, it is possible there could be a preimage collision.
     * A preimage collision can be used to attack the contract by treating one storage location as another,
     * which would always be a critical issue.
     * Carefully examine future keccak-based storage to ensure there can be no preimage collisions.
