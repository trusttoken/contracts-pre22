## `Initializable`



Helper contract to support initializer functions. To use it, replace
the constructor with a function that has the `initializer` modifier.
WARNING: Unlike constructors, initializer functions must be manually
invoked. This applies both to deploying an Initializable contract, as well
as extending an Initializable contract via inheritance.
WARNING: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke
a parent initializer twice, or ensure that all initializers are idempotent,
because this is not dealt with automatically as with constructors.

### `initializer()`



Modifier to use in the initializer function of a contract.
