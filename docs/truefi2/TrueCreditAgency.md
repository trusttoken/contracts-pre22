## `LineOfCreditAgency`



Manager for Lines of Credit in the TrueFi Protocol
https://github.com/trusttoken/truefi-spec/blob/master/TrueFi2.0.md#lines-of-credit
- Tracks interest rates and cumulative interest owed
- Data is grouped by score in "buckets" for scalability
- poke() functions used to update state for buckets
- Uses RateModel to calculate rates & limits
- Responsible for approving borrowing from TrueFi pools using Lines of Credit

Get borrow limit adjustment from rate model

### `totalTVL(uint8 decimals) → uint256` (public)



Calculate total TVL in USD


### `totalBorrowed(address borrower, uint8 decimals) → uint256` (public)

Get borrow limit for `borrower` in `pool` using rate model


### `currentRate(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, address borrower) → uint256` (external)



Get current rate for `borrower` in `pool` from rate model


### `interest(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, address borrower) → uint256` (public)

Borrow from `pool` for `amount` using lines of credit
Only whitelisted borrowers that meet all requirements can borrow


### `payInterest(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool)` (external)



Pay full balance of interest to `pool`

Borrowers should call this function at least once per payment period


### `repay(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, uint256 amount)` (public)

Internal function to update state for `bucketNumber` in `pool`

### `_pokeSingleBucket(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, uint8 bucketNumber, uint256 timeNow, uint256 poolRate)` (internal)



Internal function to update state for a single bucket


### `poolCreditValue(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool) → uint256` (external)



Calculate USD value for credit lines in pool


### `singleCreditValue(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, address borrower) → uint256` (external)



Get value of a single line of credit for `borrower` in `pool`


### `_rebucket(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, address borrower, uint8 oldScore, uint8 newScore, uint256 updatedBorrowAmount)` (internal)



Move borrower from one bucket to another when borrower score changes


### `_takeOutOfBucket(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, struct LineOfCreditAgency.CreditScoreBucket bucket, uint8 bucketNumber, address borrower) → uint256 totalBorrowerInterest` (internal)



Internal function to take `borrower` out of a bucket


### `_putIntoBucket(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, struct LineOfCreditAgency.CreditScoreBucket bucket, uint8 bucketNumber, address borrower)` (internal)



Internal function to put borrower into a bucket


### `_totalBorrowerInterest(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, struct LineOfCreditAgency.CreditScoreBucket bucket, address borrower) → uint256` (internal)



Internal helper to calculate total borrower interest in a pool based on bucket share


### `_interest(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, struct LineOfCreditAgency.CreditScoreBucket bucket, address borrower) → uint256` (internal)



Internal function to calculate interest for a single pool 


### `_payInterestWithoutTransfer(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, uint256 amount)` (internal)



Internal function to change state when msg.sender pays interest
Used before transfer to satisfy check-effects interactions


### `_payPrincipalWithoutTransfer(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, uint256 amount)` (internal)

Used before transfer to satisfy check-effects interactions


### `_repay(contract ITrueFiPool2 pool, uint256 amount)` (internal)
